    <h1>About</h1>
    I am a Ph. D candidate at Stanford University, under the supervision of Dr. Pat Hanrahan. I work in computer graphics, human-computer interaction, and programming languages. I received my BS in mathematics and computer science from the California Institute of Technology. My email address is "l yang" (without the space or quotes) at cs dot stanford.edu, and is the best way to contact me. You may also find me in the Gates building #398 on the Stanford campus. With low probability.<br> 
    <h1>Research Interests</h1>
    As we move on from procedurally generating objects and designs with simple representations such as grammars for buildings and trees, the requirement for richer representations that capture much more complex objects in increasingly compact and usable forms increases, up to and beyond general-purpose programs. Yet, increasing the complexity of the representation tends to widen the cognitive gulf between the program and the resulting output, making them hard to use. Moreover, we introduce a computational gap as well. For instance, many design problems can become intractable when expressed as a system of constraints in a declarative programming language. I am concerned with developing tools and algorithms to address these issues.<br>
