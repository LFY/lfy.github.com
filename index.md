# Lingfeng Yang

# About

I am a Ph. D candidate at Stanford University, under the supervision of Dr. Pat Hanrahan. I work in computer graphics, human-computer interaction, and programming languages. I received my BS in mathematics and computer science from the California Institute of Technology. My email address is "l yang" (without the space or quotes) at cs dot stanford.edu, and is the best way to contact me. You may also find me in the Gates building #382 on the Stanford campus.
